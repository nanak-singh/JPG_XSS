To ensure proper access control, the application should immediately invalidate or terminate all active sessions of a user when their account is marked as inactive or disabled. This prevents the user from continuing to access the system using an existing session token, which may otherwise remain valid. Implementing this logic ensures that any changes to user status are enforced in real time, maintaining the integrity and security of the application.
