HTML Injection occurs when an application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML content into web pages or emails. 
This allows malicious HTML to be injected, which could result in:

Phishing attacks by embedding fake links or forms.
Malicious redirection to attacker-controlled sites.
Script execution in email clients (in some cases if JavaScript is not filtered out).
Defacement or altering the email content.
Potential theft of user credentials or session tokens if forms or links are manipulated.

In this case, the Subscription Name field in the email is vulnerable to HTML Injection 

Recom:
Input Validation: Implement strict input validation on all user inputs. Only allow expected characters.
Output Encoding: Always encode user inputs before rendering them in emails (HTML entity encoding).
