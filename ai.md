Upload Functionality – File Type Validation Testing

The upload functionality was tested to verify the system’s ability to correctly identify and handle different file types/subtypes uploaded by users. Since direct AI interaction was not possible, various file formats such as .jpg, .zip, and .xlsx were uploaded to observe the application’s response.

Test Cases Executed:

Checked for successful upload of valid .xlsx files.

Checked for error handling when uploading corrupted or malformed files.

Checked for rejection of non-.xlsx file formats.

Checked for display of appropriate error messages on invalid file types.
